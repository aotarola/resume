    "summary": "Engineer with +10 years of experience, I have worked with Nodejs, Ruby on Rails, PHP, Python, Groovy, Elm and Javascript for the most part of my career. Iâ€™ve work frameworks such as React, Preact, Django, and CakePHP.\n\nI like type inference functional languages, my all time favorite is Elm, but I have a soft spot for Javascript. I like to tinker with my editor (nvim), and write my code at the speed of thought ðŸ˜‰.\n\nDuring my career Iâ€™ve been in the frontend, backend, platform support (CI, cloud, third party integrations), and even email deliverability. Currently, Iâ€™m specializing in Platform/Frontend and Web performance.\n\nLast but not least, I like to bake bread ðŸ¥– and brew kombucha, checkout some of my recipes at http://otarola.me\n\nI'm very passionate about the things I do, especially if the task is challenging. \n\nAnd of course, I like to learn new stuff/tech!",
